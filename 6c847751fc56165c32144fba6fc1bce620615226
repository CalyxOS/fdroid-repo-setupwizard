      "message": "I agree we should share code when its used in multiple places.  Right now, Signal isn\u0027t shared, that\u0027s why it is here.  The download function is too trivial to require a whole code sharing infrastructure, but it would be fine to move it there once that exists.\n\nHaving the same app in multiple repos is something that should be avoided, if possible.  It will make for confusing interactions related to repo priority.  As long as Signal isn\u0027t currently urgently needed in another repo, it\u0027ll be easier to only keep it here.  Then we can move towards making fdroid-repo-setupwizard a live repo that has proper support for a local offline mirror.  That will mean that fdroid-repo-setupwizard would be built on fully supported configurations rather than CalyxOS-specific hacks.  The F-Droid side of that work is funded and being scheduled now.",
