      "message": "fdroidclient works much better if it gets the metadata of previous releases.  I think that this repo should include at least 2 releases per app so that the metadata is included.  Then the process that assembles the files to put into /product/fdroid/repo should only include the latest APKs.  Then it will have the metadata without having the unneeded APKs.  If you point me to that code, I can fix that too.",
